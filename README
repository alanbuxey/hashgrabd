About
-----

Hashgrabd is a utility designed to obtain the cryptographic hashes that 
uniquely identify shared files on peer to peer networks. Hashgrabd currently 
supports the BitTorrent and eDonkey protocols.

Limitations
-----------

BitTorrent hashes are only obtained the announcement TCP packets, it does not
monitor sessions that actually transfer data. Only a limited subset of eDonkey
opcodes are implemented, these are those most likely to contain a useful valid
hash.

Outputs
-------

Hashgrabd can either output to STDOUT or a UDP network socket, each UDP packet
contains a single line that would have been output via STDOUT.

Compiling
---------

At current hashgrabd does not have a ./configure script, and should compile
successfully on most modern operating systems. It has been tested on FreeBSD
and Linux.

1. Obtain current release of hashgrabd.
# wget http://github.com/tignetworking/hashgrabd/tarball/release-current

2. Extract current release of hashgrabd, XXXXXXX will very depending on git 
   commits.
# tar xvzf tignetworking-hashgrabd-XXXXXXX.tar.gz

3. Build hashgrabd
# make

The resulting executable should be portable to move into whatever directory you
require.

Running
-------

Command-line parameters are listed upon executing the program with no 
arguements.

hashgrab: program usage
hashgrabd: -i <device>    - device to capture packets from
hashgrabd: -d             - daemonise this program
hashgrabd: -e             - grab edonkey/emule hashes
hashgrabd: -b             - grab bittorrent hashes
hashgrabd: -f <filename>  - file to capture packets to
hashgrabd: -c             - print output to console
hashgrabd: -n             - print output to network via udp
hashgrabd: -h <hostname>  - hostname to send udp to (default => localhost)
hashgrabd: -p <port>      - port to send udp to (default => 10000)
hashgrabd: "<filter>"     - bpf filter to be applied to traffic

Examples
--------

* Capture eDonkey only from eth0 and display on screen.

./hashgrabd -e -c -i eth0

* Capture both eDonkey and BitTorrent from eth0 and display on screen.

./hashgrabd -b -e -c -i eth0

* Capture BitTorrent only from eth0, export via UDP and daemonise into 
  background.

./hashgrabd -b -i eth0 -n -h localhost -p 10000 -d

* Capture BitTorrent and eDonkey packets from eth0 only outgoing from a local
  private network, exporting via UDP and daemonise into background.

./hashgrabd -b -e -i eth0 -n -h localhost -p 10000 -d "src net 10.0.0.0/8"
